Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text.

[**Documentation**](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

## **Basic syntax**

#### Headings
---
To create a heading add (#) before the text. The number of (#) corresponds to the heading level. There are 6 different headings

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
...
```


#### Emphasis
---
A text can be made bold or italic.

```markdown
Bold: **this text is bold** or __this text is bold__
Italic: *this is italic* or _this is italic_
Striketrough: ~~this text is striketrough~~
```


#### Blockquotes
---
Blockqoutes contains some useful informations about the whole section, or something, that would be impactful in some cases.

```markdown
> This would be a blockqoute, with an empty line
>
> A new line here
```

This would look like the following:

> This would be a blockqoute, with an empty line
>
> A new line here


#### Lists
---
There are two types of lists, ordered and unordered lists.
Syntax for the ordered list:

```markdown
1. First element
2. Second element
3. Third element
```

1. First element
2. Second element
3. Third element

Unordered list looks like this:

```markdown
- First element
- Second element
- Third element
```

- First element
- Second element
- Third element


#### Code blocks
---
Code blocks are used to represent some code, like python, javascript, php or any other language.

Syntax and output:

\`\`\`python
print('hello')
\`\`\``

```python
print('hello')
```


#### Links
---
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., `[Duck Duck Go]`) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., `(https://duckduckgo.com)`).
