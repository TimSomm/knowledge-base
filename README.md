# Knowledge base
---

*It is a living repository, which is always updated. I am constantly adding information as I come across it. Not everything is included, there may be errors and omissions, I collect the information that is useful for me here.*

Feel free to fork the repo, and make pull requests to contribute growing the knowledge base, or just simply use it as a cheat sheet collector.

It's made for Obsidian, so it's best to use it with it, however all "normal" notes are written in MD, and I try to avoid using obsidian features, so it should be working with any MD editor / viewer.
